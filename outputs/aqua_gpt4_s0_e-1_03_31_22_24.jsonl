Let the base of the tower be point C, and the top of the tower be point D. We have two right triangles: ACD and BCD.\n\nIn triangle ACD, we have angle DAC = 45\u00b0, so angle ADC = 45\u00b0 as well. Therefore, triangle ACD is an isosceles right triangle, and AD = CD.\n\nIn triangle BCD, we have angle DBC = 60\u00b0 and angle BDC = 90\u00b0. Therefore, angle CBD = 30\u00b0. Using the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle, we have BD = CD/2 and BC = BD * \u221a3.\n\nSince the car is traveling at a uniform speed, we can set up a proportion to find the time it takes to travel from point B to point C. Let t be the time it takes to travel from point B to point C.\n\nDistance AB / Distance BC = Time AB / Time BC\nAB / BC = 10 / t\n\nWe know that AB = CD - BD and BC = BD * \u221a3.\n\nSubstitute the expressions for AB and BC into the proportion:\n\n(CD - BD) / (BD * \u221a3) = 10 / t\n\nNow, we know that CD = AD, and AD = BD + BC.

The hollow cube consists of an outer layer and an inner layer. \n\nFor the outer layer, the cube has dimensions 5x5x5, so there are 5^3 = 125 smaller cubes.\n\nFor the inner layer, the cube has dimensions 3x3x3 (since the thickness is 1cm), so there are 3^3 = 27 smaller cubes.\n\nNow, let's find the number of painted faces of the smaller cubes. Each face of the hollow cube has 5x5 = 25 smaller cube faces painted. Since there are 6 faces on the hollow cube, there are 6x25 = 150 painted faces in total.\n\nNow let's find the total number of faces of the smaller cubes. Each smaller cube has 6 faces, so for the outer layer, there are 125x6 = 750 faces, and for the inner layer, there are 27x6 = 162 faces.\n\nThe total number of faces of the smaller cubes is 750 + 162 = 912. Subtracting the painted faces, we get 912 - 150 = 762 faces remaining.\n\nHowever, we should not count the faces that are in contact between the outer and inner layers. There are 6 faces for each of the 27 inner cubes that are in contact with the outer cubes, so there are 27x6 = 162 faces we should not count.\n\nFinally, subtracting these faces, we get 762 - 162 = 600 faces remaining. But we have counted the inner faces of the outer cubes twice. There are 6 faces for each of the 98 outer cubes (125-27) that are in contact with the inner cubes, so there are 98x6 = 588 faces we should subtract.\n\nSo the final answer is 600 - 588 = 12 faces remaining unpainted. However, this option is not available in the given answer options. There might be an error in the question or the answer options provided."}

Since the cow is tethered with a 14 feet long rope, it can graze a circular area with a radius of 14 feet. The area of a circle is given by the formula:\n\nArea = \u03c0 * radius^2\n\nIn this case, the area the cow can graze is:\n\nArea = \u03c0 * 14^2 = 3.14 * 196 = 615.44 sq.ft.\n\nNow, we know that the cow grazes 10 sq.ft. per day. To find out how many days it will take for the cow to graze the whole field, we need to divide the total area by the area grazed per day:\n\nDays = Total area / Area grazed per day\n\nDays = 615.44 / 10 \u2248 61.5\n\nSince the cow cannot graze for a fraction of a day, we round up to the nearest whole number:\n\nDays = 62\n\nSo, the cow will take approximately 62 days to graze the whole field. The closest answer option is:\n\nB) 61 days"}

Since we are given the ratio of height to semi-perimeter as 2:5, we can write the height as 2x and the semi-perimeter as 5x.\n\nNow, we know that the cost to paper the walls is Rs.260, and the paper is 50cm wide, which is 0.5 meters wide. The cost per meter is Rs.2. We also know that we need to subtract 15 sq.m for doors and windows.\n\nLet's find the area of the walls to be papered:\n\nCost = Area * (Cost per meter / Width of paper)\n260 = Area * (2 / 0.5)\n\nSolve for Area:\nArea = 260 * (0.5 / 2)\nArea = 260 * 0.25\nArea = 65 sq.m\n\nNow, we need to add the 15 sq.m for doors and windows:\nTotal Area = 65 + 15 = 80 sq.m\n\nNow, let's find the height of the room. We know that the semi-perimeter is 5x, and the total area is 80 sq.m. Since the area of a rectangle is length * width, we can write:\n\nArea = Height * Perimeter\n80 = 2x * (5x * 2)\n\nSolve for x:\n80 = 20x^2\nx^2 = 80 / 20\nx^2 = 4\nx = 2\n\nNow, we can find the height of the room:\nHeight = 2x = 2 * 2 = 4 meters\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n\nC)4m"}

Since Jack has done 8 hours of work, there are 12 - 8 = 4 hours of work remaining for Jill to do.\n\nSince Jill's rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do, it will take her 20 times longer to do the same amount of work.

Since Jill's rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do, it will take her 1 / 0.05 = 20 times longer to do the same amount of work.\n\nSo, to finish the remaining 1/3 of the work, Jill will take 20 times longer than Jack would take to do the same amount of work.

When Joe is as old as his father (J + x = F), his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father (F + x = 2(F - y), where y is the number of years it takes for Joe's sister to be as old as her father).\n\nFrom equation 2, we can get x = S. So, J + S = F. Now, we can rewrite equation 3 as F + S = 2(F - y), or y = (3/2)S.\n\nNow, we can rewrite equation 1 as J + 2S = 100. Since J + S = F, we can substitute F into the equation, getting F + S = 100. \n\nWe know that y = (3/2)S. Since S + y = F, we can substitute this into the equation, getting S + (3/2)S = 100. Solving for S, we get S = 40.\n\nNow, we can find F: F = J + S = 100 - S = 100 - 40 = 60. So, Joe's father's age is 60, which is not in the given answer options. There might be an error in the question or the answer options provided."}

To do this, we can rearrange the equation to solve for m:\n\nm = (x * 100) / (4y)\n\nNow, we need to express m as a percentage of x. We can do this by dividing m by x and multiplying by 100:\n\n(m / x) * 100 = ((x * 100) / (4y)) / x * 100\n\nSimplify the equation by canceling out the x terms:\n\n(100 / (4y)) * 100 = 25 / y * 100\n\nNow, multiply 25 by 100:\n\n25 * 100 / y = 2500 / y\n\nSo, m is 2500 / y percent of x.
